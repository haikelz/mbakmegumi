  Katou Megumi is one of the main heroines from the anime Saekano: How to Raise
  a Boring Girlfriend. At first glance, she may appear like the “ordinary girl
  next door,” but that’s exactly what makes her so extraordinary. Unlike the
  typical flashy anime heroines, Megumi stands out because of her calm presence,
  subtle charm, and the way she brings balance to everyone around her. She’s the
  heart of the story, often grounding the chaos caused by the more eccentric
  characters. Her quiet confidence, warm personality, and effortless elegance
  make her unforgettable. Megumi doesn’t need to shout to be noticed—her
  strength lies in her sincerity, her ability to listen, and the way she makes
  others feel comfortable just by being herself. What makes her even more
  captivating is how she grows throughout the series. From being perceived as
  “too normal,” she proves that true beauty lies in authenticity. Megumi shines
  in her own unique way: she’s intelligent, kind, supportive, and has a gentle
  yet witty sense of humor that makes every interaction feel genuine.
